This is a very simple stack-based virtual machine, written in C++.

The word length is currently 32-bit, you have 1 Mb at your disposal
for text + memory, and the opcodes can be found by compiling and
running:

g++ sm.cpp -osm
./sm -h

Currently, the only program it will run is hard coded.  It is, however,
trivial to load it from standard input or similar.
