This is a very simple stack-based virtual machine, written in C++.

The word length is currently 32-bit, you have 1 Mb at your disposal
for text and memory.  The opcodes can be found by compiling and
running:

  make all
  ./sm-run -h

To test out some programs:

  make all check

A working, but incomplete, assembler can be found in sm-compile.cpp.
An example hello world program can be found in hello.src, with a
Fibonacci number generator in compiled bytecode in fib.sm.
